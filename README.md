# ![MQTT](mqtt.png) `mqtt` - MQTT for kdb+

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kxsystems/mqtt?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/kxsystems/mqtt/releases) [![Travis (.org) branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/kxsystems/mqtt/master?label=travis%20build)](https://travis-ci.org/kxsystems/mqtt/branches)

This interface lets you communicate with an MQTT broker from a kdb+ session. 
The interface follows closely the [PAHO MQTT C API](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c). 
Exposed functionality includes

-   connect to a MQTT broker
-   subscribe to topics
-   publish to a broker

This is part of the [_Fusion for kdb+_](http://code.kx.com/q/interfaces#fusion/) interface collection.

## New to kdb+ ?

Kdb+ is the worldâ€™s fastest timeseries database, optimized for ingesting, analyzing and storing massive amounts of structured data. To get started with kdb+, please visit https://code.kx.com/q/learn/ for downloads and developer information. For general information, visit https://kx.com/

## New to MQTT ?

Message Queueing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a machine-to-machine/IOT connectivity protocol. It is designed to provide a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol.

MQTT is used commonly for constrained devices with low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.

### Use cases

This messaging protocol is used extensively where a small software footprint is required, e.g.

-   communication with edge devices/sensors
-   home automation
-   mobile applications

## Installation Documentation

## Debugging/Tracing

:point_right: The underlying Paho MQTT library provides the ability to log diagnostic information to standard out or log files via an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) as detailed [here](https://eclipse.dev/paho/files/mqttdoc/MQTTClient/html/tracing.html)

## Building From Source

:point_right: [`Building guide`](docs/build.md)

## Quick start

### Requirements

To run the examples you will need a MQTT broker e.g.

- [Mosquitto broker](https://mosquitto.org/download/)

### Start Mosquitto

Start Mosquitto on default port `localhost:1883`.

```bash
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

### Launch consumer

We assume you are in the source directory of the MQTT-kdb+ interface.

```bash
mqtt]$ cd q
q]$ q ../examples/consumer.q 
```


### Launch producer

In the same directory as the one launching a consumer, run:

```bash
q]$ q ../examples/producer.q
```


Then pubish a message by a timer, say every second:

```q
q)\t 1000
```

Going back to the console of consumer, now you can see received messages in `.mqtt.tab`:

```q
q).mqtt.tab
topic  msg_sent                      msg_recv                      received_m..
